# CVE4Technology

sets the technology and version to search for, and sets the URL for the NVD website. It then sets the params for the search, which includes the adv_search flag to enable advanced search, the cpe_version parameter with the technology and version specified, and the startIndex and resultsPerPage parameters to control the pagination of the results.

The script then sends a GET request to the NVD website with the search parameters and parses the HTML response using the BeautifulSoup library. It then gets the table element with the id of "vuln-list-table", which contains the list of CVEs.

The script then iterates over the rows in the table and gets the columns in each row. It skips rows that don't have at least 5 columns, as these rows don't contain the necessary information for a CVE. For each valid row, it gets the CVE ID and description from the first and fifth columns, respectively, and appends this information to the cves list.

After the loop, the script prints the cves list, which will show the cve_id and description for each CVE that was found for the given technology and version. You could modify this script to save the cves list to a JSON file or a database, or to display the results in a web page
